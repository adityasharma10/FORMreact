                Project(Configuration of Logic App to send Mail when a user post on twitter)
08-May-2020 (Friday)
        All the members worked over the following topics:
        *Creating a Microsoft Azure Account.
        *Creating a resource group.
        *what is a logic app and its scope.
        *Deployment of a Logic App.
        A zoom meeting was arranged so that all members can communicate on a common
platform and discussed the process in which we will proceed to complete the project
although this project was very simple as per the AIM provided and could be completed
in an hour.
